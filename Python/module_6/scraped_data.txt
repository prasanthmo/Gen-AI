Furniture For Eat-In Kitchen
If you don’t have a formal dining room, you probably have an eat-in kitchen, breakfast nook, or open-plan dining room. Eat-in kitchens and breakfast nooks put the seating right within reach of the cooking space for maximum convenience. Bring the host or hostess closer to the company by adding some bar stools to your kitchen counter. Don’t have an outward-facing kitchen counter? Not a problem! A kitchen island provides you with space for seating and food prep, and you can pair it with a small kitchen table or dinette set for more seating.
Are Formal Dining Rooms Out of Style?
Traditionally it was the style in America and Britain to have a completely separate room for dining, which more often than not was only used for dinner parties and special occasions. But now formal dining rooms with their connotation of polished silverware and fancy china have fallen out of favor with homeowners who want to enjoy their meals in a more relaxed and informal setting and view a seldom-used room as unnecessary. But that’s not to say Formal dining rooms have completely gone away – if you like to get fancy every now and then, or you are a messy cook and prefer to keep all the pots and pans out of eyesight for your guests, a separate formal dining room may be right for you. When shopping for Formal dining, Formal dining sets are larger than casual ones so they are able to seat more people. Normally formal dining room sets are 7 pieces or larger, featuring a rectangular table with 6 or more chairs, usually two of which are arm chairs.
